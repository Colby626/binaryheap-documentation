# Binary Heap Documentation
## OVERVIEW

Briefly define the data structure and hint at why a programmer might care about it. For example, an overview of a linked list might look like: 

"A linked list is a data structure that is easy implement and is useful for storing sequences of objects for which the max number of objects is unknown or varies frequently. Linked lists are often used as a basis for implementing more complex data structures. This document explains the basics of implementing a linked list in C++ and provides an example Visual Studio solution."

## HOW DOES IT WORK?

This section explains in detail how the data structure works and how someone might go about implementing it in real code. If the student is writing about an existing STL implementation, this section still explains how the data structure works but focuses on the STL API instead of implementation details. This section should most likely be a mixture of natural language as well as short code snippets. Students should feel free to create diagrams if they would illustrate your point well. The tutorial should refer to the example code in the repository where appropriate. In short, the author should do whatever he or she feels is most appropriate to convey the information in an effective and interesting way. 

Students do not necessarily need to describe time and memory complexity for the data structure (Big-O notation), but that may be helpful in the description depending on your approach. It will likely be difficult to give a complete picture of the data structure without explaining (at least casually) the time complexity of adding, removing, and accessing elements.

## HOW IS THIS DATA STRUCTURE USEFUL?

What sorts of data is this structure commonly used for? Why is it a better solution for certain applications than similar data structures? This section should discuss these generalities but also describe at least one specific example of an appropriate usage (For example, queues are ideal for handling OS input events such as key presses and mouse movements in the order the user makes them). 

## FURTHER READING

Students should cite any sources they used in preparing this tutorial (with inline citations in the text, as appropriate). It is okay to base an implementation on an existing one as long as the student makes significant changes to the code and properly credits the source. This section may also include recommendations for other sources the reader may find helpful. These sources can be URLs or traditional Works Cited entries for published material.

It is important to correctly cite the sources used. It is okay to look at other code. It is not okay to turn in other people's code and misrepresent it as your own.
